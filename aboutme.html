        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This is the story of the boy with the videos. It all started in 2018
            when I discovered the incredible world of drones. At just 9 years
            old, I saved my allowance for a whole year to buy my first drone, a
            DJI Tello. The moment it arrived, my life changed. With every
            flight, I discovered a new world, seeing places in ways I had never
            imagined.

            The drone’s camera fascinated me, and it didn’t take long before I
            created a YouTube channel where I shared videos about drones and my
            daily life. Two years later, I invested in a DJI Phantom, a more
            advanced drone, and that’s when my passion for filmmaking was born.
            It was no longer just about flying—it was about creating images that
            told stories.

            At 12, I edited my first video for a neighbor and realized that my
            passion could become a profession. I started studying intensely,
            taking audiovisual courses, filming for local businesses, and
            building my portfolio. My dedication caught the attention of a
            filmmaker who invited me to shoot and edit weddings, where I learned
            a lot about the professional market.

            Today, with two years of experience as the lead editor at a wedding
            production company, I am responsible for every detail of the videos,
            from editing to color grading. I also work as a freelancer, focusing
            on editing and color grading, always striving to exceed expectations
            and take each project to the next level.
          </li>

            My journey started with a drone and a dream. Today, I turn stories
            into videos that move and connect.
